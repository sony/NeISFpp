        rays_o (Tensor): the origin of rays (b_size, 3).
        rays_d (Tensor): the direction of rays (b_size, 3).
        r (float): radius of the bounding sphere.

        (Tensor): computed intersections (b_size, 1).

    Note:
        This function assumes that the cameras are inside the sphere.
        This function is solving the following equation for t.
        1. a = rays_o + t * rays_d (t > 0).
        2. ||a|| = r.
        Because we are assuming t must be larger or equal to zero, we discard the smaller solution.
